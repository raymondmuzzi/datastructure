# Data Structure

## Abstract
Data structure is the sepcialized compulsory course for CS.

Data structure is the study of how data is organized and stored in computer. To learn this course, we can know how to retrive and modify data efficiently.

- Array linked list
- Constructs a BST (add,contains,remove)


## Recursive
We can split the recursive problem into two parts:
- the basic problem
- transforms the original problem into smaller problem

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

Binary search tree is a binary tree.
Every node in binary search tree, its value is larger than all left
tree nodes' value and smaller than all right tree nodes' value.

Every child tree is also the binary search tree.

BST's in-order recursive traversing will arrange all the element in order

In-order non-recursive iteration practice

Iterate the BST via layer, i.e. level-order iterate, which will be functional while finding one element

## Priority Queue

Priority Queue: Enqueue and dequeue sequence determined by the priority

The queue will change dynamically with the data's changing
