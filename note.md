# Data Structure

## Abstract
Data structure is the sepcialized compulsory course for CS.

Data structure is the study of how data is organized and stored in computer. To learn this course, we can know how to retrive and modify data efficiently.

## Self-check-practice

- Array
- Stack
- LeetCode(20)
- Queue
- Loop Queue
- LinkedList
- LinkedList(use dummy head)
- LinkedList(Stack,Queue)
- LeetCode(203)
- Accomplish linked list via recursive

## Recursive
We can split the recursive problem into two parts:
- the basic problem
- transforms the original problem into smaller problem
